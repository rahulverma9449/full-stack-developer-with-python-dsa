Return Subsequences
Send Feedback
Given a string (let's say of length n), return all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain the same as in the input string.
Note: The order of subsequences are not important.
Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc
