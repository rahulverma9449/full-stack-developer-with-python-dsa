Print Subsequences
Send Feedback
Given a string (lets say of length n), print all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.
Note :
The order of subsequences are not important. Print every subsequence in new line.
Input format
The input only consists of one line which consists of a single string
Output format
The output consists of all subsequences of the input string where each subsequence is printed in a different line. The order of the subsequences doesn't matter
Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 15
where |S| represents the length of the input string

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc
