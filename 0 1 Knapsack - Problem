Send Feedback
A thief robbing a store can carry a maximal weight of W into his knapsack. There are N items, and i-th item weigh 'Wi' and the value being 'Vi.' What would be the maximum value V, that the thief can steal?
Input Format :
The first line of the input contains an integer value N, which denotes the total number of items.

The second line of input contains the N number of weights separated by a single space.

The third line of input contains the N number of values separated by a single space.

The fourth line of the input contains an integer value W, which denotes the maximum weight the thief can steal.
Output Format :
Print the maximum value of V that the thief can steal.
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 20
1<= Wi <= 100
1 <= Vi <= 100
