Binary Play
We are given a series of Binary Strings. The first term in this series is 0. Hence, T1 = '0'.
To find the string at any given Ti, we look at Ti - 1 and replace all occurances of '0' with '01' and '1' with '10'.
You are given two integers N and X, your job is to find TN and return its Xth index.
Note: Ti are 1-indexed.
Input Format:
First line of input contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
The next T lines contains two space separated integers, N and X.
Constraints:
Output Format:
 Print the Xth index in Nth row
Sample Input:
1
4 5 
Sample Output:
1
Explanation:
T1: '0'
T2: '01'
T3: '0110'
T4: '01101001'
The 5th element in T4 is '1'.
