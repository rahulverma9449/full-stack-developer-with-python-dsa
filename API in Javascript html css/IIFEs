Create an IIFE which returns two functions, increase and initialize. The function initialize will take an initial value of the counter and increment would increase the counter by 1 and return it.
For initial value 1 it will give 2,3,4...

//Write your function here


const counter = (function () {
    let c = 0;
    function initialize(start) {
        c = start;
    
    }
    function increase() {
â€¦    process.exit();
});
