print details()
Send Feedback
Follow the steps given below to produce the desired result.
1. Fix the code below by deleting the printDetails() function from the Student object and adding it to the Student prototype object. 

2. Then create 4 new instances of the Student object by setting the id, name, club values to (1, “Raj”, “Cricket”), (2, “Rohan”, “Dance”), (3, “Rita”, “Basketball”) and (4, “Reema”, “Music”). 

3. Now create an array of these 4 objects.

4. Run a loop on the array you created and call each object's printDetails() function.


****************************************
function Student(id, name, club){
    this.id = id ;
    this.name = name ;
    this.club = club ;
    this.printDetails = function(){
        console.log(this.id, this.name, this.club);
    }
}
var student1 = new Student(1, "Raj", "Cricket");
var student2 = new Student(2, "Rohan", "Dance");
var student3 = new Student(3, "Rita", "Basketball");
var student4 = new Student(4, "Reema", "Music");

var studentsArray = [student1, student2, student3, student4];

for(var student of studentsArray) {
    student.printDetails();
    
}
